* It seems that **when a gentle feeling of fondness or liking is generated** from an individual, people always feel they are happy at the moment most often.

After using `unnest_tokens`, weâ€™ve split each row so that there is one token (word) in each row of the new data frame; the default tokenization in `unnest_tokens()` is for single words, as shown here.
